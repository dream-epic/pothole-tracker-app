# RoadSafe üõ£Ô∏è

An interactive map visualization project that provides solutions to identify and report potholes.

## Project Description

Potholes are areas of road surface that have cracked, worn away, and eventually formed a hole. Potholes can be dangerous not only for drivers, but for motorcyclists, bicyclists, pedestrians, and road workers as well. This problem is particularly severe in Chicago because of its harsh winters and extreme freeze-thaw cycles.
This project provides Chicago citizens access to real-time pothole locations as well as a platform to report freshly grown holes. A reported pothole will immediately show on the map once page is refreshed. It also provide an AI chatbox for FAQs and complaints.
